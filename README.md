# Explosion Test

## Intro

This program is written to do simple boom tests, and it includes four kinds of tests, which are "mao" for common air composition, "ter" based on ["ter graph"](https://github.com/TyeYeah/ExplosionTestQTDemo/blob/master/ter.jpg), "lechart" based on ["le chart"](https://github.com/TyeYeah/ExplosionTestQTDemo/blob/master/le%20chart.jpg), and "kukuczka" for checking ["kukuczka"](https://github.com/TyeYeah/ExplosionTestQTDemo/blob/master/kukuczka.png) explosibility.

Those above are familiar to students who studying Combustion Science, and this can be a roughcast for them to build their customed tool.

## Ter graph

You can input composition of N2, H2, and O2 to see it is explosive or not.
The graph is down here, and we can see in the red triangle surrounded by 0% N2, 94% H2, and 4% H2, it is explosive.

## Le chart

You can input Ratio of two gas and the real value (percent flammable gas plus diluent).
In this Le chart, If data is inside the relevent curve, then it explodes.

## Kukuczka

Input CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO, N2, H2, and O2 to see its explosibility.
It is a method to determine the mine gas explosibility.
